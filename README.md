## About App
<ul>
<li>
In this, I have developed the app where user can take MCQ and answers are based true-false. User can also skip the question by pressing the next button and if by mistake pressed 
next can come back to the same question. Animations provide better user experience which helps user understand whether the option they chose is right or wrong.</li>
<li>Questions have been fetched via online using volley library and in order to achieve this, we need to give Internet permission in the appâ€™s manifest file.</li>
<li>The scoring system given will provide +10 for right answer and -5 for wrong answer.</li>
<li>Data Binding helps in providing easy way of using the UI widgets.</li>
<li>Shared Preferences help in storing highest score of the user as well as the current question so that he/she can come back to the app to start from where they left off.</li>
<li>The project follows MVC architecture for other app developers understand code better and have better reusability.</li>
</ul>
